# Course Management Application

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application focused on managing courses. It uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to implement the backend API, with a basic frontend for interaction.

## Features

- Create new courses with details such as name, author, description, and thumbnail.
- View a list of available courses.
- Update existing course information.
- Delete courses from the list.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (You can use a local installation or a MongoDB Atlas cloud database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://yourrepositorylink.com/course-app.git
cd course-app
```

2. Install NPM packages:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

4. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage
